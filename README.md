# 🚀 HopIt – Hopper Iterative System Analysis Tool

**HopIt** is a modular Python tool for performing an iterative system-level mass estimation of a hopper (small rocket vehicle). It evaluates propellant mass, tank sizing, propulsion, batteries, structure, and more – until mass convergence is reached.

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flxbrt/hopit.git
cd hopit


2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python ≥ 3.8 installed. Then install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the tool
bash
Kopieren
Bearbeiten

python main.py


By default, it runs with a hardcoded config defined inside main.py. The tool will:

Load system configuration

Estimate subsystem masses

Iterate until total mass convergence

Print the result (if sys_print = True)

Optionally store output (if store_system = True)


⚙️ Configuration


config = {
    'Flight Time [s]': 80,
    'Oxidizer': 'O2',
    'Fuel': 'C2H5OH',
    'Oxidizer Pump': False,
    'Fuel Pump': False,
    'Fuel Self Pressurised': False,
    'Oxidizer Self Pressurised': False
}

Later versions may load this from a .json or .yaml file.



💡 Features
Iterative loop for consistent subsystem mass convergence

Tank sizing via CasADi-based nonlinear solving

Modular code structure (easy to extend with additional subsystems)

Designed for conceptual rocket vehicle studies


📌 Planned Enhancements
CLI interface with argparse

JSON-based config loading

Plotting of key subsystem masses

Web-based visualization (long-term)
